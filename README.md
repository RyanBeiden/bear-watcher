# Bear Watcher

This project is a basic form where you can add the name and image URL of a bear that will be added to a Brooks River section. The goal of this project was to experiment with JavaScript ES6 Modules. It gives the codebase better organization, making it very easy to find and fix or add content in the right place without having to search too far.

#### Backlog/Roadmap

- Build buttons that log the timestamp of when a bear either attempted to catch a fish or successfully caught a fish
- Show how many fish were caught by each bear
- Build an awards section that displays the top 3 bears who have caught the most fish
